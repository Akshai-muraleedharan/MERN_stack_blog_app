           <p className='leading-7 dark:text-dark-paragraph'>Welcome to Dev Blog, a simple space dedicated to helping beginners take their first steps into the world of software development! This blog is my very first project, and it's created with the intention of making learning to code as easy and accessible as possible. If you're new to programming, don’t worry – everything here is designed to help you learn at your own pace, starting with the basics and gradually building your knowledge.</p>
           <p className='leading-7 dark:text-dark-paragraph mt-2'>In this blog, I’ll share easy-to-understand tutorials, tips, and lessons on various topics related to development. Whether you’re learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or just getting started with web development, you’ll find content that breaks down complex concepts into simple, digestible pieces. This project is a personal journey of mine, and I hope that by sharing what I’ve learned, I can help others who are just starting out in coding. So, let’s learn together and build something great!</p>
